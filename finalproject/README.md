My final project centres around my favourite hobby basketball! As someone who has recently moved to a new area I decided to make a website to help the local basketball community.
Where I used to live I had an indoor basketball court, and my new area only has outdoor courts. There were so many nuances of planning to play basketball outdoors that I was not
aware of! When is the sunset - will it get dark soon? Is it windy - will my ball fly out of control every time I shoot? Has it rained recently - is the ground too wet to play on?

To help the community I created a basketball website which serves two purposes. One is to check if the weather is in fact good to play outdoor basketball. It does this by pulling
data from a free API, Openweatherdata, and displays an emoji weather the current conditions satisfy good conditions to play basketball. These conditions are current weather
conditions, the chance of rain in the next hour, and how windy it currently is.

As someone new to the area I also wanted to connect fellow hoopers with a message board. You may post anonymously or after signing in. To post you fill out a form determining
what you are looking for it a fellow hooper and your availability. After posting the message gets saved in a SQL database and any message posted in the last 24 hours is displayed
on the noticeboard.
